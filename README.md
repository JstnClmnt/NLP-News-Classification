# Topic Identification of Filipino and English News using Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory with Attention Mechanisms

Topic Identification of News using BiLSTMs with Attention Mechanisms. Our data for the English News came from BBC News

## Getting Started

Download the dataset from http://mlg.ucd.ie/files/datasets/bbc-fulltext.zip and extract it in a folder named ``` /data ```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - with Tensorflow Backend
* [Tensorflow 1.12](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
* [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)


### Installing

Create also a folder named ```/Graph_LSTM``` and ```/Graph``` so tensorboard will save the files there for the Ordinary LSTMs and LSTMs with Attention


## Code

Just run the ```.ipynb``` file in your Jupyter Notebook and you're good to go.
